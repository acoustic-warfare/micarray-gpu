%   IMPORTANT!!!! The beamforming algorithm assumes the array matrices lies in the
%   xy-plane
%
%   The beamforming algorithm calculates the necessary phase to introduce
%   to the narrowband signal in order to have a maximum directivity in the
%   direction r(theta,phi)
%
%   This phase shift is introduced by a phase shifting function, which acts
%   as a filter in time domain
%
%   To improve performance, all elements of the array matrices are not in
%   use. The user decides which element to use by sending in a weight
%   vector as an argument. The output signal is also then normalized after
%   how many elements where in use.
